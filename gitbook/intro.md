# Short Introduction of GitBook


[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) documentation tool is briefly introduced in this section.

GitBook doc is written with [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language. 
Markdown is a [lightweight markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language).

Advantages of documentation with Markdown - GitBook:

* Clean markup, raw plain text is also readable, instead of the sophisticated markup language, like HTML and LaTeX.
* Managable for structured, large documentations, *i.e.* write books.
* Supporting locally output form: html, pdf, epub ... with `gitbook`.
* Web hosted [site](https://www.gitbook.com), load the raw text from Github, for collaborative documentation writing.

some useful online resources:
* GitBook [project on Github](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook)
* GitBook [official documentation](http://help.gitbook.com/). 
* Gruber's syntax [site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

**Our markup standard** should make the source readable in Github, 
this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) works well because it's a Github wiki.
